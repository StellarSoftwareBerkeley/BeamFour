====COMPILING.TXT====

1.  Get your compiler version:    
        javac -version
    and enter the version on line 19 of B4constants.java where it will become available
    to the Help::About dialog. 

2.  Compile all .java files using the -Xlint option and check for errors and warnings:
        javac -Xlint *.java

3.  Group all the resulting .class files into an executable .jar file:
        jar cmf manifest.txt outputname.jar *.class
    where manifest.txt specifies the entrypoint class "B4". See Oracle docs. 

4.  On most Linux systems, one must mark the .jar as executable, not merely an archive.
    To do this, right click the .jar icon, choose Properties/General "Open with JDK" 
    and if available "Set as Default." Then on Permissions tab, click "Make the file executable."  


Build 166 has 37 files, listed below.
  
  to list source files use..    ls *.java | xargs -n1 basename
